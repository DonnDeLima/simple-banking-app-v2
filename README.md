## **Introduction**
The Simple Banking App is a web-based application designed to facilitate secure and efficient basic banking operations for both regular users and administrators. Developed using the Flask framework and powered by a MySQL database, the app allows users to create accounts, log in securely, manage their personal and financial information, and perform transactions such as sending money to other users. Each user is assigned a unique account number and can view their current balance and transaction history. The application features robust security mechanisms including password hashing with bcrypt, session management with Flask-Login, CSRF protection, and rate limiting to prevent abuse. Administrators and managers have special access rights to monitor user activity and manage the system. The backend is configured through environment variables for flexibility across different deployment environments. Additionally, a well-structured SQL schema ensures data integrity and performance through the use of indexing and foreign key relationships. A reliable foundation for digital banking operations, balancing simplicity with the essential features needed in a secure financial platform.
